used guvcview to set the camera settings. the same settings seemed to persist when running the webcam program, even after exiting guvcview,
so was able to use guvcview to adjust the camera settings for the webcam program.

to run the webcam program, telling it to use the config in the file webcam.config

$ webcam webcam.config

webcam.config looked like this
[grab]
device = /dev/video0
width = 640
height = 480
delay = 3
rotate = 0
top = 0
left = 0
bottom = -1
right = -1
quality = 95
trigger = 0
once = 0
archive = /home/nrasheed/Desktop/webcam/archive/img-%H%M%S.jpg

note that can set "once=1" to have it take a single image and exit. that is useful for testing.

ran the following to stich the jpgs into a single avi
$ mencoder "mf:///home/nrasheed/Desktop/webcam/archive/img*.jpg" -mf fps=25 -o /home/nrasheed/Desktop/webcam/archive/movie.avi -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=msmpeg4v2:vbitrate=1200

used ffmpeg to convert avi to wmv
$ ffmpeg -i movie.avi -s 640x480 -b 1000k -vcodec wmv2 -ar 44100 -ab 56000 -ac 2 -y movie.wmv
